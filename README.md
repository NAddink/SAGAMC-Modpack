#### sagamc-modpack

# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Install prism launcher from https://prismlauncher.org/ 
You should have to log into your Microsoft account to use minecraft. If prism doesn't prompt you, click the profile in the top right.  

2. Grab [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ROAQy29DxbLmMpvmGYCQ8BbDzLGWG_UW/view?usp=sharing) zip file and in prism go to `Add Instance` > `import` and select the zip file

Run! That should be it!  
The zip file is just an empty 1.20.1 forge setup with one mod, packwiz  
which grabs all the mods from a configured list (this github actually).  

Packwiz should automatically check for changes to the mod list every time you launch Minecraft.
If the modpack updates, and I update the config here, when launching, the pack should update automatically.

Notes to Noah:  
`.\packwiz.exe curseforge import "path-to-zip.zip"`  
Will import mods from curseforge zip file

`.\packwiz.exe curseforge detect`  
Will setup links for curseforge mods  


But also you should just be able to add mods via id

### Also don't upload configs because those will overwrite user configs.
