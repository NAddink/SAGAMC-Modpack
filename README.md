Notes to Noah:  
`.\packwiz.exe curseforge import "path-to-zip.zip"`  
Will import mods from curseforge zip file

`.\packwiz.exe curseforge detect`  
Will setup links for curseforge mods  


But also you should just be able to add mods via id

### Also don't upload configs because those will overwrite user configs.
